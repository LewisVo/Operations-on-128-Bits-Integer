# Operations on 128 Bits Integer

### Purpose

This project does some basic operations ( both arithmetic and bitwise ) on very big Integers (128 Bits)

### Tools used

* Visual Studio 2015 (VC++ 14)
* Boost Library

### Folder Structure

Source code and a bunch of test file is included inside EX01 folder.

### Example 

Some sample inputs and outputs

The program takes input from file and output to another file. The first or both the first and the second number of an input line indicates whether you are referring to decimal, binary or hex. 

Supported operators :
* From Dec to Bin 
* From Bin to Dec
* From Hex to Bin
* From Bin to Hex
* Operator =, +, -, \*, /
* Operator &, |, ^, \~
* Logical Shift left, right
* Rotating bits left, r
